# Gym Equipment Manager
# This project uses polymorphism to handle various types of gym equipment. Each equipment type (like dumbbells, barbells, and treadmills) is managed through a common interface. Workout plans dynamically calculate costs by combining different equipment types, showcasing the flexibility of polymorphism in managing gym routines.
